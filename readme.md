# AgriGPT: Fine-Tuned GPT-2 Agricultural Assistant with Integrated Crop Recommendation System

**AgriGPT** is a dual-function digital platform designed to support farmers with **agricultural knowledge** and **data-driven crop recommendations**. It integrates a **GPT-2 AI assistant** for answering queries and a **Machine Learning crop recommendation system** that predicts suitable crops based on soil and environmental parameters.

## Features

- **AI Agricultural Assistant**
  - Fine-tuned GPT-2 model for agricultural Q&A.
  - Provides accurate, context-aware responses to farmer queries.
  - Side-by-side comparison with vanilla GPT-2.

- **Crop Recommendation System**
  - Predicts suitable crops using Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
  - Inputs: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH, rainfall, temperature, humidity.
  - Random Forest achieved **99.32% accuracy**.

- **Web Application**
  - Built with **Flask**.
  - Intuitive interface with navigation between AI Assistant and Crop Recommendation.
  - Simple forms and clear output displays for farmers.
